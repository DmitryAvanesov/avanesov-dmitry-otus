# About
Here I implemented a react app that allows you to search for weather forecasts in different cities and save them to favorites.

# Description
I used webpack + babel for bundling and compiling my code.  
The code itself is written in typescript react using redux.  
I used react-router for declarative routing and redux-thunk + axios for async API calls.

# How to
cd react  
npm install  
npm run start (or webpack-dev-server)

# Notes
I also used SCSS for styling. Styles are handled by webpack.
