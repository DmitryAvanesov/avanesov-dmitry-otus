# About
Here I implemented the sum() function that can summarize passed numbers as follows: sum(a)(b)...(n) = a + b + ... + n. Calling the function without parameters returns the sum of all previously passed numbers.

# Description
I used valueOf property of the function to store passed numbers. To implement consecutive calls I returned the function itself in case of a defined parameter.

# How to
Launch javascript-1.html file and check the console.
