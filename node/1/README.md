# About
Here I implemented the server and requests scripts in order to send sequential or parallel requests to the server.

# Description
Server works 100ms on each request. In case of sequential requests, I just sent them one-by-one in a loop. To perform parallel ones I used 'parallel-http-request' module.

# How to
Execute 'node node-1-request.js *numberOfRequests* *requestType*' in terminal.

# Notes
Node.js breaks my brain lol.
