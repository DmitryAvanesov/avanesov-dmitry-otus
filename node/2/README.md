# About
Here I implemented my-tree and my-leaf custom elements to transform JSON into DOM.

# Description
My-tree element takes a 'tree' property and defines tree's root which is my-leaf element. My-leaf renders itself and recursively renders its child leafs.

# How to
Having required modules installed, execute 'npm run start' in terminal.

# Notes
You can change the future DOM structure inside index.html file.
