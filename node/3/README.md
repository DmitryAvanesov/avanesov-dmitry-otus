# About
Here I implemented getTreeFromPath() function that transforms a path string into an object.

# Description
The resulting object has 2 fields - for files and dirs inside the root path folder. File system calls are asynchronous.

# How to
Execute 'npm run tree -- *path*' in terminal.

# Notes
To do: use promises to wait for file system calls' execution.
